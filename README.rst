Prescriptions to heal your applications and application dependencies.

What are prescriptions?
=======================

This repository keeps a database of known issues in Python open-source
projects as well as suggestions for Python libraries and runtime
environments they can run in. The database is used in
`Thoth <https://thoth-station.ninja/>`__ to resolve high quality Python
software stacks.

  When using OpenShift or Kubernetes, one provides manifest files that state
  how the desired state of a cluster should look like. Prescriptions might
  be seen analogous to this - prescriptions provide a way to declaratively
  state how the desired dependency resolution should look like considering
  the prescribed rules. Then, it‚Äôs up to the reinforcement learning algorithm
  implemented in `Thoth's adviser <https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser>`__
  to find a solution in the form of a lockfile respecting the prescribed rules,
  requirements for the application and other inputs to the Thoth's cloud
  resolver.
