## Microsoft Plus Digital Media Edition Crack \_\_LINK\_\_ Serial Key Keygen

  
With the release of Windows 10 Creators Update (build 1703), Microsoft has changed the way Windows activation works. Previously, each device had a unique OA3 Digital Product Key (DPK) that was stored in the BIOS and used to activate Windows. However, now the system does not always show the original DPK as the current key in the device. Instead, it follows these steps:

When a device is activated for the first time, it contacts the Microsoft activation servers and sends them the device ID and the original DPK. The activation servers then generate a digital license for the device and link it to the Microsoft account (if signed in) or the hardware ID. The digital license is stored on the activation servers and can be used to reactivate the device in the future.
  
If the device needs to be reactivated after a hardware change or a reinstall of Windows, it will contact the activation servers again and try to use the digital license. If the digital license matches the device ID or the Microsoft account, the device will be activated with a generic product key that is different from the original DPK. The generic product key will be shown as the current key in the device, but it is not tied to the device and cannot be used to activate other devices.
  
The original DPK is still stored in the BIOS of the device and can be retrieved using third-party tools or commands. However, it is not necessary to use the original DPK to activate Windows 10 Creators Update or later versions, as long as the digital license is valid. The original DPK can still be used to activate older versions of Windows or other editions of Windows 10 that are not covered by the digital license.
  
The main benefit of this change is that it simplifies the activation process and makes it more flexible. Users do not need to keep track of their product keys or enter them manually when reinstalling Windows. They can also link their digital license to their Microsoft account and use it to activate their device on different hardware configurations, as long as they meet the activation limit. The digital license also allows users to upgrade to Windows 10 from eligible versions of Windows 7 or 8.1 without needing a product key.
  
However, there are also some drawbacks and limitations of this change. Users who want to transfer their Windows license to another device or person may face difficulties, as the digital license is tied to the original device or Microsoft account. Users who want to downgrade or change their edition of Windows 10 may also need to use the original DPK or purchase a new product key. Users who do not have internet access or who have privacy concerns may not want to use the digital license feature and prefer to use the traditional product key method.
  
Therefore, users should be aware of the pros and cons of this change and decide which activation method suits them best. They should also keep a record of their original DPK and their digital license status in case they need to troubleshoot any activation issues in the future.
